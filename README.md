## Installation

### Simple Installation Steps

1. **Open EDMC Plugins Folder**:
   - Launch EDMarketConnector
   - Go to **Settings** > **Plugins** tab
   - Click the **"Open"** button

2. **Download the Latest Release**:
   - Visit the [Latest Release Page](https://github.com/Fenris159/EDMC_GalaxyGPS/releases/latest)
   - Download the **Source code (zip)** file
   - **Important**: Always use releases from this repository (`Fenris159/EDMC_GalaxyGPS`)

3. **Extract and Install**:
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file
   - Create a folder named **`EDMC_GalaxyGPS`** in your plugins directory
   - Copy all extracted files into this folder
   - Ensure the structure looks like: `plugins/EDMC_GalaxyGPS/GalaxyGPS/`, `plugins/EDMC_GalaxyGPS/load.py`, etc.

4. **Restart EDMC**:
   - Close and restart EDMarketConnector
   - The plugin should appear in the plugins section

### Linux Users - Clipboard Setup

**Standard Linux (X11):**

- Install **xclip**: `sudo apt-get install xclip` (Debian/Ubuntu) or equivalent for your distribution

**Wayland Users:**

- Install **wl-clipboard**: `sudo apt-get install wl-clipboard`
- Set environment variable: `export EDMC_GALAXYGPS_XCLIP="/usr/bin/wl-copy"`
- See [Wayland Support](#wayland-support) section below for detailed setup instructions

---

## Requirements 📋

To use all features of GalaxyGPS, you'll need to configure the following in EDMC:

### CAPI (Companion API) - Required for Fleet Carrier Features

1. Open EDMC Settings
2. Navigate to the "Frontier Auth" or "CAPI" tab
3. Follow the instructions to authenticate with Frontier's servers
4. Ensure fleet carrier data fetching is enabled

**Why it's needed**: GalaxyGPS uses CAPI to automatically track your fleet carrier(s) location, fuel, balance, cargo, stored ships, and modules. Without CAPI, fleet carrier features won't work.

### EDSM API - Required for Icy Rings/Pristine Detection

1. Open EDMC Settings
2. Navigate to the "EDSM" tab
3. Enter your EDSM API key (get one from [EDSM.net](https://www.edsm.net/en/settings/api))
4. Ensure the connection is active

**Why it's needed**: The plugin queries EDSM to determine if a carrier's current system has icy rings and if they're pristine quality. This information helps you find the best mining locations.

### INARA API - Optional but Recommended

1. Open EDMC Settings
2. Navigate to the "Inara" tab
3. Enter your INARA API key (get one from [INARA.cz](https://inara.cz/settings/api/))

**Why it's recommended**: While most INARA features work via web links, having the API enabled provides better overall EDMC integration.

## How GalaxyGPS Works 🎮

### Route Planning Methods

**Import from Spansh:**

- Generate any route type on Spansh Plotter (Galaxy, Fleet Carrier, Road to Riches, Neutron, etc.)

- Import it just like a Spansh route
- The plugin handles the rest!

**Plot Directly:**

- Use the "Plot Route" button in GalaxyGPS
- Enter start system, destination, and jump range
- Adjust efficiency slider for route preferences
- Click "Calculate" to generate the route via Spansh API

### Route Management Features

- **Route Resumption**: If you reload a route, it automatically continues from where you are
- **View Route Window**: See your entire route with all details, links to Inara/EDSM, and visual indicators
- **Auto-Refresh**: The route window updates automatically as you progress

### Fleet Carrier Features

- **Automatic Tracking**: Carriers are tracked automatically via CAPI
- **Detailed Views**: Access cargo manifests, stored ships, and outfitting modules
- **Smart Warnings**: Get notified when Tritium restocking is needed

## Technical Details 🔧

### Wayland Support

If you're using a Wayland desktop environment, you need to configure the plugin to use **wl-copy** instead of xclip.

#### Standard Wayland Installation (Non-Flatpak)

1. **Install wl-clipboard**: `sudo apt-get install wl-clipboard` (or equivalent)
2. **Set Environment Variable**:

   ```bash
   export EDMC_GALAXYGPS_XCLIP="/usr/bin/wl-copy"
   ```

   Or add to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

   ```bash
   echo 'export EDMC_GALAXYGPS_XCLIP="/usr/bin/wl-copy"' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

#### Flatpak Users

**Option A - Using Flatseal (Recommended):**

1. Install Flatseal: `flatpak install flathub com.github.tchx84.Flatseal`
2. Open Flatseal and select EDMarketConnector
3. Enable **Wayland windowing system** in Socket section
4. Enable **All system libraries, executables and static data** in Filesystem section
5. Add environment variable in Environment section:
   - **Name**: `EDMC_GALAXYGPS_XCLIP`
   - **Value**: `/run/host/usr/bin/wl-copy`
6. Restart EDMC

**Option B - Using Command Line:**

```bash
flatpak override --user io.edcd.EDMarketConnector \
  --socket=wayland \
  --filesystem=host-os \
  --env=EDMC_GALAXYGPS_XCLIP=/run/host/usr/bin/wl-copy
```

Then restart EDMarketConnector.

### Fleet Carrier CAPI Integration

The plugin automatically tracks your fleet carrier(s) using Frontier's CAPI. When EDMarketConnector fetches fleet carrier data, the plugin:

- **Automatically stores** all carrier information (location, fuel, balance, cargo, ships, modules, state, theme, etc.)
- **Saves data to CSV files** for easy access and backup:
  - `fleet_carriers.csv` - Main carrier information
  - `fleet_carrier_cargo.csv` - Detailed cargo manifest
  - `fleet_carrier_ships.csv` - Stored ships information
  - `fleet_carrier_modules.csv` - Stored modules information
- **Updates automatically** when you dock at your carrier or when journal events occur

All CSV files use UTF-8 encoding with BOM and persist between EDMC restarts. See `Documentation/CACHE_MODULES_README.md` for detailed column structure information.

### Plugin Priority

The plugin appears as **GalaxyGPS** in the EDMC plugin list (alphabetically with your other plugins). If you prefer navigation to load above other plugins, you can manually force it to sort first:

1. Open your EDMC plugins folder and go into the **`EDMC_GalaxyGPS`** folder.
2. Open **`load.py`** in a text editor.
3. Find the line `return 'GalaxyGPS'` (inside the `plugin_start` function, near the end).
4. Change it to `return '!GalaxyGPS'` (add an exclamation mark before the name).
5. Save the file and restart EDMC.

EDMC sorts plugins alphabetically by the name returned from the plugin. The leading `!` sorts before letters, so GalaxyGPS will appear at the top of the list. This is an optional local change; plugin updates may overwrite it, so you would need to reapply the change after updating if you want to keep it at the top.

### Public API

GalaxyGPS provides a stable public API for other EDMC plugins to access route and carrier data. See `Documentation/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` for complete API reference and `examples/galaxygps_api_example/` for usage examples.

## Updates 🔄

GalaxyGPS features an **automatic update system** that checks for new versions when EDMC starts.

### How Auto-Updates Work

1. **Automatic Check**: When EDMC starts, the plugin checks GitHub for new versions
2. **Update Notification**: If available, a dialog shows the new version and changelog
3. **Installation**: If you choose to install, the update downloads when you close EDMC
4. **Manual Updates**: You can also download releases manually from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Fenris159/EDMC_GalaxyGPS/releases)

**Note**: Auto-updates require an active internet connection and only download if you confirm the installation prompt.
